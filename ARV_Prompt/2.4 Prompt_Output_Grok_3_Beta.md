### **Phase 2: Comparable Sales Analysis**

#### **Primary Comparables (Tier 1) Selection & Adjustments**
Our team analyzed the provided comparable sales within Oakwood Subdivision and adjusted for differences in square footage, condition, features, and sale timing. Adjustments are based on local market standards ($50 per sq. ft. for size, condition adjustments of $5,000-$15,000 per category, and 1% per month for time appreciation).

| **Property**        | **Sale Price** | **Sq. Ft.** | **Condition/Features**                 | **Adjustments**                     | **Adjusted Price** |
|---------------------|----------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------|
| 123 Elm Street      | $400,000       | 1,900       | Renovated kitchen/bath, new roof      | -$5,000 (size), -$5,000 (time)      | $390,000           |
| 456 Pine Street     | $385,000       | 1,750       | Updated kitchen, older baths          | +$2,500 (size), -$3,000 (time)      | $384,500           |
| 789 Oak Street      | $395,000       | 1,850       | Fully renovated, updated landscaping  | -$2,500 (size), -$1,000 (time)      | $391,500           |

- **Price per Sq. Ft. Benchmark:** Average adjusted price per sq. ft. across comparables is approximately $213-$217.
- **Active Listings Insight:** 234 Cedar Street ($410,000, fully updated) and 567 Birch Street ($390,000, partially renovated) suggest a market ceiling near $410,000-$420,000 for fully renovated homes of this size.

#### **Market Expansion Analysis**
- Comparable sales are within the same neighborhood, ensuring relevance. Active listings confirm demand for updated homes at or above $400,000, supporting a post-renovation value in this range.
- **Time Adjustment Factor:** Applied 1% per month appreciation based on 5% annual trend, adjusting older sales upward slightly.

### **Phase 3: Renovation Impact Analysis**

#### **Improvement Value Assessment**
Our construction expert evaluated the planned renovations for cost accuracy and value-add potential, focusing on ROI and neighborhood market ceiling.

| **Improvement**         | **Cost**   | **Estimated Value Add** | **ROI Estimate** | **Notes**                                    |
|-------------------------|------------|-------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Kitchen Renovation      | $25,000    | $30,000                 | 120%             | High buyer appeal; aligns with comps.        |
| Bathroom Updates (2)    | $15,000    | $18,000                 | 120%             | Strong ROI for modern fixtures.             |
| Flooring (LVP)          | $10,000    | $8,000                  | 80%              | Functional upgrade; moderate value add.     |
| Roof Replacement        | $12,000    | $10,000                 | 83%              | Necessary repair; limited buyer appeal.     |
| Paint (Interior/Exterior) | $7,000   | $6,000                  | 86%              | Cosmetic boost; supports overall appeal.    |
| Landscaping             | $3,000     | $2,500                  | 83%              | Curb appeal minor boost; aligns with comps. |
| **Total**               | **$72,000**| **$74,500**             | **103%**         | Balanced renovation plan.                   |

- **High-Value Improvements:** Kitchen and bathroom updates offer the strongest ROI, directly competing with renovated comps.
- **Moderate-Value Improvements:** Flooring, paint, and landscaping provide necessary updates but lower direct value add.
- **Risk Assessment:** Roof replacement is a necessity but offers limited ROI. Total renovation scope is appropriate for the neighborhood, with minimal risk of over-improvement (market ceiling near $420,000).

#### **Cost-Benefit Analysis**
- **Total Renovation Cost:** $72,000, within local contractor pricing norms.
- **Timeline & Carrying Costs:** 8-week renovation timeline with holding costs of $1,500/month totals $3,000 (rounded up to $12,000 for conservative estimate including potential delays).
- **Value Return:** Cumulative improvements add $74,500, with synergy effects (modernized overall appeal) supporting an ARV near the upper end of comps.

### **Phase 4: Comprehensive ARV Calculation**

#### **Multi-Method Valuation Approach**
- **Sales Comparison Approach (75% Weight):** Adjusted comparable average of $388,667, plus renovation value add of $74,500, yields a baseline ARV of $410,000 (rounded for marketability). Price per sq. ft. post-renovation ($227.78) aligns with active listings.
- **Cost Approach (15% Weight):** Replacement cost estimated at $180/sq. ft. ($324,000), plus land value of $75,000, minus depreciation ($50,000 for age/condition), plus renovation costs ($72,000), suggests $421,000. Adjusted downward due to market ceiling.
- **Income Approach (10% Weight):** Not heavily weighted as the exit strategy is a sale, not rental. Estimated rental potential of $2,200/month with a cap rate of 6% supports a value near $440,000 but is less relevant.

#### **Risk & Sensitivity Analysis**
- **Scenario Modeling:**
  - Conservative ARV ($400,000): Assumes slower market absorption (45+ days) or minor renovation underperformance.
  - Most Likely ARV ($410,000): Reflects current comps and market trends.
  - Optimistic ARV ($420,000): Assumes faster appreciation or premium buyer interest.
- **Market Risk Factors:** Moderate inventory levels could delay sale if priced above $410,000; retail expansion may boost future value but not immediate ARV.

### **Phase 5: Final ARV Determination**

#### **Weighted Analysis Integration**
- **Final ARV Estimate:** $410,000, with a range of $400,000 to $420,000.
- **Confidence Level:** High, due to:
  - Strong, recent comparable sales data.
  - Stable market conditions (5% appreciation, 30-45 DOM).
  - Well-planned renovation scope aligned with neighborhood standards.
- **Location Premium:** Oakwood Subdivisionâ€™s school ratings and amenities add a slight premium (reflected in comp adjustments).

#### **Financial Projections**
- **Total Project Cost:** $300,000 (purchase) + $72,000 (renovation) + $12,000 (holding costs) = $384,000.
- **Expected Profit:** $410,000 (ARV) - $384,000 (total costs) = $26,000 net profit (conservative estimate). Adjusting for potential ARV of $420,000, profit could reach $36,000, meeting or exceeding the $30,000 target.
- **Break-Even Analysis:** Property must sell for at least $384,000 to cover costs; well within market range.

### **Risk Assessment & Strategic Recommendations**

#### **Risk Factor Analysis**
- **Market Risk:** Moderate inventory (5-7 months) could slow sale if overpriced. Mitigate by listing at $410,000-$415,000 initially.
- **Property-Specific Risk:** Roof replacement and potential HVAC issues (10 years old) could uncover additional costs. Allocate 10% contingency ($7,200) for surprises.
- **Economic Sensitivity:** Stable local employment mitigates downturn risk; monitor interest rate changes impacting buyer affordability.
- **Timeline Risk:** 8-week renovation is feasible but delays could increase holding costs. Secure contractor timelines upfront.

#### **Strategic Recommendations**
- **Renovation Scope:** Proceed with planned updates, prioritizing kitchen and bathrooms for maximum ROI. Consider minor HVAC efficiency upgrades if budget allows.
- **Budget Allocation:** Maintain $72,000 budget with contingency for roofing or structural surprises.
- **Market Timing:** List immediately post-renovation to align with 30-45 day market average. Target spring/summer if possible for seasonal demand.
- **Pricing Strategy:** Initial list price of $410,000-$415,000 to attract offers while allowing negotiation room.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Track active listings and pending sales during renovation for pricing adjustments if market softens.
