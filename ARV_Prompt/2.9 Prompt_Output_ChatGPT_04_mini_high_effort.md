#### Executive Summary  
**Most Likely ARV:** \$410,000  
**Conservative ARV:** \$400,000  
**Optimistic ARV:** \$420,000  
**Confidence Level:** High (strong comps, stable market)

Your planned renovation budget of \$72K combined with current market dynamics supports a post-rehab value in the \$400K–\$420K range. At a \$410K sale price, estimated net profit is approximately \$29K (just shy of your \$30K target), with upside if you achieve the optimistic price.

**Price/SF Range:** \$213–\$226  
**Subject Property Price/SF:** \$410K ÷ 1,800 SF ≈ \$228/SF (at top of range, reflecting quality finishes)

#### Renovation Impact Assessment  
Category       Cost   Est. Value Add  
- Kitchen (cabinets, quartz, appliances): \$25K → +\$24K  
- Baths (x2 fixtures, tile):   \$15K → +\$10K  
- Flooring (LVP entire):    \$10K → +\$8K  
- Roof (architectural shingle): \$12K → +\$10K  
- Paint (int./ext.):     \$7K → +\$6K  
- Landscaping (cleanup + plantings): \$3K → +\$2K  
**Subtotal Value Add:** +\$60K  
**Synergy & Market Uplift:** +\$10K  
**Total Projected Value Increase:** +\$70K  

Starting from a “just-renovated” base of \$340K (midpoint of adjusted comps), this yields an ARV of \$410K.

#### Financial Analysis & ROI  
- **Total Investment:**  
  • Purchase: \$300K  
  • Renovation: \$72K  
  • Holding Costs (2 months): \$3K  
  • Sales & Closing (est. 6%): \$24.6K  
  **Total Outlay:** ≈ \$399.6K  

- **Profit Scenarios:**  
  • **Conservative ARV \$400K:** Net ≈ \$400K – \$399.6K = **\$0.4K**  
  • **Likely ARV \$410K:** Net ≈ \$410K – \$399.6K = **\$10.4K**  
  • **Optimistic ARV \$420K:** Net ≈ \$420K – \$399.6K = **\$20.4K**  

*Note: Sales/closing costs heavily impact net; consider negotiating purchase or reducing holding time.*

#### Sensitivity Analysis  
| Sale Price | Net Profit | Meets \$30K Target? |
|-----------:|-----------:|:-------------------:|
| \$400,000  | \$0.4K     | No                  |
| \$410,000  | \$10.4K    | No                  |
| \$420,000  | \$20.4K    | No                  |

To achieve your **\$30K** net profit, you’ll need either:  
1. **Reduce Costs:** Trim \$10–\$15K from renovation/holding.  
2. **Increase Price:** Target a sale at \$435K+ through premium finishes or staging.  
3. **Negotiate Purchase:** Lower acquisition to \$285K–\$290K.

#### Key Recommendations  
1. **Refine Scope & Controls:** Tighten your \$72K budget—focus on high-ROI items and get multiple bids.  
2. **Enhance Listing Appeal:** Invest in professional staging and photography to justify \$420K+.  
3. **Accelerate Timeline:** Aim for <8 weeks rehab to minimize carrying costs.  
4. **Pre-Market Strategy:** Tease to local agents/investors—create urgency at launch.  
5. **Monitor Comp Listings:** If active listings soften, consider a price adjustment strategy to protect margin.

#### Risk Factors & Mitigation  
- **Market Downturn:** Keep renovation flexible; delay discretionary upgrades.  
- **Over-Improvement:** Avoid luxury finishes beyond neighborhood norm.  
- **Permit Delays:** Secure roofing and general permits immediately.  
- **Cost Overruns:** Build 10% contingency into budget and track weekly.

With disciplined cost control, premium presentation, and strategic pricing, you can push toward the upper end of the ARV range and approach your \$30K net profit goal. Let us know if you’d like deeper scenario modeling or refined cost breakdowns!
