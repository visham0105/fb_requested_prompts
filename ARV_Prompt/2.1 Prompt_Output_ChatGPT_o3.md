#### üõ†Ô∏è Renovation Impact Assessment
| Improvement | Budget | Avg. Resale Lift* | Added Value | ROI |
|-------------|--------|-------------------|-------------|-----|
| Kitchen overhaul | $25,000 | 75‚Äì85 % | ~$21,000 | 0.84 |
| Two bath updates | $15,000 | 70 % | ~10,500 | 0.70 |
| LVP flooring | $10,000 | 80 % | 8,000 | 0.80 |
| New roof | $12,000 | 90 % (near-mandatory) | 10,800 | 0.90 |
| Paint in/out | $7,000 | 100 %+ | 7,500 | 1.07 |
| Landscaping | $3,000 | 50 % | 1,500 | 0.50 |
| **Total** | **$72,000** | ‚Äî | **$59,300** | **0.82** |

\*Lift = incremental contribution to final market value (based on local paired-sales).

**Observation:** Full scope recoups ~82 % of cost in market value. Over-scope risk sits mostly in landscaping & high-end finishes; potential to trim $8-10 K.

#### üìà Market & Economic Context
‚Ä¢ Prices up **~5 % YoY**; absorption 5-7 months = balanced market.  
‚Ä¢ Mortgage rates hovering 6.5 %‚Äîbuyer pool sensitive to price.  
‚Ä¢ Retail-center expansion (2 yrs out) mildly positive but outside flip horizon.  
‚Ä¢ No major new-build competition; existing stock ages >30 yrs.

#### ‚öñÔ∏è Risk & Sensitivity
| Variable | -10 % Shock | Base | +10 % |
|----------|-------------|------|-------|
| Sale price | $364 K | $405 K | $445 K |
| Net profit (after all costs) | ‚Äì$44 K | ‚Äì$2 K | +$38 K |
| Days on market | 75 | 45 | 30 |
| Holding cost impact | +$4.5 K | +$3 K | +$2 K |

**Key Risks**  
1. **Market softening** while project is listed (inventory creep).  
2. **Over-improvement** beyond neighborhood ceiling (> $430 K).  
3. **Hidden defects** (HVAC/structural) blowing budget.  
4. **Rate spike** reduces buyer affordability.

---

#### üí° Strategic Recommendations
1. **Price / Cost Realignment**  
   ‚Ä¢ Target purchase price **‚â§ $275 K** _or_ cut renovation to ~$60 K (scale back flooring & landscaping) to secure ‚â• $30 K profit.  
2. **Scope Tweaks**  
   ‚Ä¢ Keep kitchen/bath & roof (highest ROI).  
   ‚Ä¢ Consider cleaning existing cabinets + quartz counters (save ~$6 K).  
3. **Timeline Discipline**  
   ‚Ä¢ 8-week schedule is aggressive; pad 2 weeks contingency; every extra month adds $1.5 K carrying + opportunity risk.  
4. **Exit Flexibility**  
   ‚Ä¢ If list-to-contract drags >60 DOM, pivot to rental (est. $2,300/mo; 6.5 % cap on $405 K) and refi out.  
5. **Contingency & Monitoring**  
   ‚Ä¢ Allocate 10 % ($7 K) contingency; weekly budget vs. schedule check-ins; pull back discretionary finishes if costs overrun by week-4.
